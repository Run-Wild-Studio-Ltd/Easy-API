# Importing your Content

After finishing the field mapping process, you can proceed to import your content. Upon initiation, you'll encounter an overview screen featuring a loading bar that indicates the progress of your import. If any errors arise during the process, notifications will be displayed on this screen.

Once the import begins, you are free to navigate away from this page, as your import is executed as Craft queue jobs. The status of your API import can be monitored at any time through the queue job sidebar notification.
