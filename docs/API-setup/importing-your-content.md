# Importing your Content

Once the API setup is completed and the import setpu with regards to Craft elements, as this relies on FeedMe's default behavior, your will see a progress screen with a progress bar. It is safe to navigate away from this screen as the import happens in the Craft queue. The status of your API import can be monitored at any time through the queue job sidebar notification.
