# Element Types

Selecting which element type your import targets is the first step in using Easy API. As each element type is different, the presented [mapping](../feature-tour/field-mapping.md) options will be unique.

## Built-in Importers

The following element types are supported by Easy API, out of the box:

- **[Core element types](https://runwildstudio.co.nz/docs/4.x/elements.html):** Assets, categories, entries, tags, and users;
- **[Craft Commerce](https://plugins.runwildstudio.co.nz/commerce):** Products and variants;
- **[Digital Products](https://plugins.runwildstudio.co.nz/digital-products):** Digital products;
- **[Calendar by Solspace](https://plugins.runwildstudio.co.nz/calendar):** Events;
- **[Verbb Comments](https://plugins.runwildstudio.co.nz/comments):** Comments;

::: tip
Plugins can add support for their own [custom element types](../developers/element-types.md), as well.
