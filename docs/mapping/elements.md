# Element Types

Selecting which element type your import targets is the first step in using Easy API. As each element type is different, the presented [mapping](../feed-setup/mapping) options will be unique.

## Built-in Importers

As this plugin is based on Feed Me, the following element types are supported by Easy API, out of the box:

- [Core element types](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/elements.html): Assets, categories, entries, tags, and users;
- [Craft Commerce](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce): Products and variants;
- [Digital Products](https://plugins.craftcms.com/digital-products): Digital products;
- [Calendar by Solspace](https://plugins.craftcms.com/calendar): Events;
- [Verbb Comments](https://plugins.craftcms.com/comments): Comments;

Plugins can add support for their own custom element types, as well.
