# Element Types

Selecting which element type your import targets is the first step in using Easy API. As each element type is different, the presented [mapping](../feed-setup/mapping) options will be unique.

## Built-in Importers

As this plugin is based on Feed Me, the following element types are supported by Easy API, out of the box:

- **[Core element types](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/elements.html):** Assets, categories, entries, tags, and users;
- **[Craft Commerce](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce):** Products and variants;
- **[Digital Products](https://plugins.craftcms.com/digital-products):** Digital products;
- **[Calendar by Solspace](https://plugins.craftcms.com/calendar):** Events;
- **[Verbb Comments](https://plugins.craftcms.com/comments):** Comments;

::: tip
Plugins can add support for their own [custom element types](../developers/element-types.md), as well.
