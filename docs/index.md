# About Easy API

Easy API is a companion app for FeedMe that allows you to connect to authorised API's through your favorite FeedMe interface.

## Features

- APIs are saved to allow easy re-processing on-demand, or to be used in a Cron job.
- Simple field-mapping and duplication handling interface to match your API data with your element fields through FeedMe.
- Uses Craft's Queue service to process APIs in the background and schedule recurring processing.
- Troubleshoot API processing issues with logs.
- Add API data directly into your templates for templating live pulls.
